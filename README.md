# Hangman game

## About this game
This hangman game is a word-guessing game in which the player tries to guess a secret word by suggesting letters. It starts with a hidden word on a screen. The player tries to guess letters using the keyboard. For each incorrect guess, a part of a "hangman" figure is drawn on the screen. The game ends when the player successfully guesses the secret word, or when the hangman figure is complete.
